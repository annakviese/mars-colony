![Alt text](https://github.com/annakviese/mars-colony/blob/master/documentation/mars-colony.png)

#### About
The Mars Colony App was created in order to understand how to build build mobile apps using Angular 2 and Typescript. 
This app allows to register user id in the session storage and get the id back when a report is created by the same user. 
I have added an animation when switching between the different states. 

#### Technology Used

* Angular 2
* Typescript 
* CSS / CSS3
* SASS 
* HTML/ HTML 5

#### Improvements 

* I would love to add animated border color when input is invalid. 
* Create a more consistent design throughout the app.
* Add animation to the circle on the welcome component.
